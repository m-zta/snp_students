# 04 - OpenMP
___
## 1. Introduction
In this laboratory we wish to explore the application of the OpenMP framework. We shall be using the results of the data decomposition lab (lab_03) as a code base.  

There is one lab session dedicated to this laboratory. The laboratory will be marked. Group work is highly recommended. 
___
## 2. Learning Aims

1.	The basics of openMP
2.	The conceptual similarities of OpenMP as compared to the direct use of processes and threads as units of execution (UE) 
3.	The (syntatic) simplifications that OpenMP provides as opposed to direct use of threads and processes as units of execution.
4.	The operational similarities of OpenMP as compared to the direct use of processes and threads



___
## 3. Task 1: Application of OpenMP
**Recommended ET & IT**

Convert your data decomposition program into an openMP variant. 

You must be careful to ensure that your program acttually works in parallel. Use htop, for instance, to show this. 

Be prepared to explain the following: 

1. What was the process of converting to OpenMP?
2. How is boundary data handled? 
3. What other design constraints did you consider? 
4. Would you do it that way again? 

___
## 4. Evaluation

This laboratory is evaluated on the basis of the discussions with you on your code/solution. You can receive a maximum of 5 marks for this laboratory.    

A perfect solution is good. An imperfect solution is acceptable. If your solution doesnâ€™t work, then it an identification of the problems and mistakes made will be accepted for grading. 

I **welcome** in-depth discussions on the contents of the lab and your solutions **during** the implementation process.
