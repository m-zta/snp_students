# 01 - Setup Laboratory

## 1. Introduction
In this exercise we want to setup a computing platform environment such that we are able to code programs associated with various laboratories and run them on the computing platform. A number of platforms are in use for the module and each has its own set-up peculiarities. The list of relevant/available computing platforms is in section 3.2.

No points will be awarded for completion of this laboratory exercise.
You can do this exercise in groups.
One laboratory period (1.5 hrs.) is considered adequate for this exercise.

## 3. Task: Setup a Computing Platform

### 3.1. Prerequisites
1. MPC-device
    1. uSD card with at least 8GB capacity (included with the board)
    2. u96 power supply
    3. microUSB cable
2. Personal Laptop
    1. SSH client installed (ssh, PuTTY, ...)
    2. Byte level copy software (dd, cat, BalenaEtcher)
    3. Decompression utility such as (unzip, 7-zip, zip, ...)
    4. Webbroser (Firefox, Opera, Chrome, ...)

Basic knowledge of command line usage in Linux is expected. Tutorials are available online, e.g. [BASH-Grundkurs](http://www.ernstlx.com/linux90bash.html), [Basic commands](https://maker.pro/linux/tutorial/basic-linux-commands-for-beginners), or similar.
